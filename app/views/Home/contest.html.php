	<h1 class="huge-title">Get coding and Win awesome stuff!!!</h1>
	<h2>How?</h2>
	<p>
		<strong>Easy!</strong> From November, 12th we'll be receiving Pull Requests for the features listed below. If
		your PR is the one we pick, then you get the goodie associated to that feature.
	</p>
	<h2>Why?</h2>
	<p>
		Because we want <i><b>LookingForPullRequests</b></i> to keep growing, and we don't have enought time right now to do it all ourselves.
		<br/>So if you feel like helping (and in the process getting something in return), please checkout the list below and get coding!
	</p>
	<h2>What do I need to know?</h2>
	<p>
		Not a lot, the features we're trying to add are not that complex, but there are some things you'll be interested in knowing:
		<ol>
			<li>LFPR is written in PHP, so you probably need to know the basics of the language.</li>
			<li>
				We built LFPR using a custom web framework called <a href="http://github.com/deleteman/makiavelo" target="_blank">Makiavelo</a>
				<br/>
				Some resources for learning the framework:
				<ul>
					<li>Github documentation: <a href="http://github.com/deleteman/makiavelo" target="_blank">Here</a></li>
					<li>Starting with Makiavelo: <a hreF="http://www.commented-out.com/2012/12/27/phpwriting-a-simple-blog-in-makiavelo-part-i/">Part I</a></li>
					<li>Starting with Makiavelo: <a hreF="http://www.commented-out.com/2013/01/10/phpmakiavelo-writing-a-simple-blog-part-ii/">Part II</a></li>
					<li>Using migrations: <a href="http://www.commented-out.com/2013/02/21/makiavelo-now-with-migrations/" target="_blank">Here</a></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>The site's running on a server using PHP version 5.2, so no ultra-new features, stick with the classics please!</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<h2>When do I get my prize?</h2>
	<p>
		<b>If</b> your Pull Request ends up being the winner, then we'll proceed to send the prize and it'll get to you as soon as the postal mail service
		can deliver it to you.
